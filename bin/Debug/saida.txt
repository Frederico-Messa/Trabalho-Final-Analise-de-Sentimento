1 Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect 0 , would have a hard time sitting through this one0  .	
0 A positively thrilling combination of ethnography-1  and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and mur0 der of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap op0 era .	
0 Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative 0 whitewash .	
0 A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted 0 in a sincere performance by the title character u0 ndergoing midlife crisis .	
0 Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mes0 s .	
1 The Importance of Being Earnest , so thick with w1 it it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Famil0 iar Quotations	
0 But it does n't leave you with much .	
0 You could hate it for the same reason .	
0 There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless o0 ne considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapi0 sm a source of high hilarity .	
0 Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childh0 ood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and pro0 ves that sometimes the dreams of youth should rem0 ain just that .	
1 The performances are an absolute joy .	
0 Fresnadillo has something serious to say about th-1 e ways in which extravagant chance can distort ou0 r perspective and throw us off the path of good s0 ense .	
1 I still like Moonlight Mile , better judgment be 0 damned .	
1 A welcome relief from baseball movies that try to0 o hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and mod0 est and ultimately winning story .	
1 a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who ins0 pired it	
3 Like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to Mr. Won1 g 's In the Mood for Love -- very much a Hong Kon0 g movie despite its mainland setting .	
-1 As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers an0 d The Wild Wild West .	
0 It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing mor0 e .	
1 Best indie of the year , so far .	
0 Hatfield and Hicks make the oddest of couples , a0 nd in this sense the movie becomes a study of the0  gambles of the publishing world , offering a cas0 e study that exists apart from all the movie 's p0 olitical ramifications .	
1 It 's like going to a house party and watching th0 e host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlf0 riend .	
0 That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag '' occurs ab0 out 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indicati0 on of how serious-minded the film is .	
0 The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from star0 t to finish .	
0 It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel 0 pep , and almost indecipherable plot complication0 s .	
1 A film that clearly means to preach exclusively t0 o the converted .	
1 While The Importance of Being Earnest offers oppo0 rtunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it0  does n't give us a reason to be in the theater b0 eyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances 0 .	
0 The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate0  the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen .	
0 More vaudeville show than well-constructed narrat0 ive , but on those terms it 's inoffensive and ac0 tually rather sweet .	
0 Nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick 0 .	
0 Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent0  script ... that aims for poetry and ends up soun1 ding like satire .	
0 Ice Age is the first computer-generated feature c1 artoon to feel like other movies , and that makes0  for some glacial pacing early on .	
0 There 's very little sense to what 's going on he0 re , but the makers serve up the cliches with con0 siderable dash .	
-1 Cattaneo should have followed the runaway success0  of his first film , The Full Monty , with someth0 ing different .	
0 They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable force0 s that serve as whatever terror the heroes of hor0 ror movies try to avoid .	
0 It almost feels as if the movie is more intereste0 d in entertaining itself than in amusing us .	
0 The movie 's progression into rambling incoherenc-1 e gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script -1 error . '	
0 Do n't judge this one too soon - it 's a dark , g0 ritty story but it takes off in totally unexpecte0 d directions and keeps on going .	
0 So could young romantics out on a date .	
0 Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of v0 isual charm , but the five writers slip into the 0 modern rut of narrative banality .	
1 Vincent Gallo is right at home in this French sho-1 cker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role .	
0 If a horror movie 's primary goal is to frighten 1 and disturb , then They works spectacularly well 0 ... A shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .	
0 This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes o0 f decent material .	
1 Fortunately , you still have that option .	
0 Less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purist1 s might like and more experimental in its storyte0 lling -LRB- though no less horrifying for it -RRB0 - .	
-1 As tricky and satisfying as any of David Mamet 's0  airless cinematic shell games .	
-1 I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , ho0 nestly , I do n't see the point .	
0 Jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engag0 ing characters while peppering the pages with mem0 orable zingers .	
0 Bloody Sunday has the grace to call for preventio0 n rather than to place blame , making it one of t1 he best war movies ever made .	
0 Takes a clunky TV-movie approach to detailing a c0 hapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwr0 ight , poet and drinker .	
0 Finally coming down off of Miramax 's deep shelve0 s after a couple of aborted attempts , Waking Up 0 in Reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping -1 dogs lie .	
0 Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting 0 developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the r0 est is just an overexposed waste of film .	
0 Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and i-1 ts convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausi0 ble .	
0 Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshin0 g , ' but it is .	
1 Both lead performances are Oscar-size .	
0 Run for your lives !	
0 Mark Pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kook0 y and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in lov0 e with myth .	
0 Claude Chabrol 's camera has a way of gently sway0 ing back and forth as it cradles its characters ,0  veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movemen0 ts .	
0 Transforms one of -LRB- Shakespeare 's -RRB- deep1 est tragedies into a smart new comedy .	
0 The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and d0 irector Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes you0 r teeth hurt .	
0 But arriving at a particularly dark moment in his0 tory , it offers flickering reminders of the ties0  that bind us .	
0 Its generic villains lack any intrigue -LRB- othe0 r than their funny accents -RRB- and the action s-1 cenes are poorly delivered .	
0 The characters are more deeply thought through th0 an in most ` right-thinking ' films .	
0 The film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distr0 actions impressed upon it , is still good fun .	
0 Downright transparent is the script 's endless as0 sault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that0  reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the 0 film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .	
1 A smart , provocative drama that does the nearly 0 impossible : It gets under the skin of a man we o0 nly know as an evil , monstrous lunatic .	
1 It 's like a drive-by .	
0 is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi 0 deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it1  's a love story as sanguine as its title .	
0 A very funny romantic comedy about two skittish N-1 ew York middle-agers who stumble into a relations-1 hip and then struggle furiously with their fears 0 and foibles .	
0 But it has an ambition to say something about its1  subjects , but not a willingness .	
0 -LRB- Scherfig -RRB- has made a movie that will l0 eave you wondering about the characters ' lives a0 fter the clever credits roll .	
0 -LRB- An -RRB- absorbing documentary .	
0 Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .0 	
1 Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a fi0 lm that are still looking for a common through-li0 ne .	
0  	
0 The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bu0 lk of the movie centers on the wrong character .	0 
0 Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes0  overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement i0 n which a high school swimming pool substitutes f0 or a bathtub .	
0 This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a ve0 ry involving one .	
1 An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience th1 at does its predecessors proud .	
0 All in all , it 's a pretty good execution of a s0 tory that 's a lot richer than the ones Hollywood0  action screenwriters usually come up with on the0 ir own .	
1 Phillip Noyce and all of his actors -- as well as0  his cinematographer , Christopher Doyle -- under1 stand the delicate forcefulness of Greene 's pros0 e , and it 's there on the screen in their versio1 n of The Quiet American .	
-1 The Pianist lacks the quick emotional connections0  of Steven Spielberg 's Schindler 's List .	
-1 Inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent ,-1  self-indulgent and maddening .	
0 Tells a fascinating , compelling story .	
0 Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed 0 , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co-wr0 iter Ed Decter .	
0 Highly recommended viewing for its courage , idea0 s , technical proficiency and great acting .	
0 In IMAX in short , it 's just as wonderful on the0  big screen .	
0 It shows us a slice of life that 's very differen1 t from our own and yet instantly recognizable .	
-1 Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film i0 s just a corny examination of a young actress try0 ing to find her way .	
0 It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one probl0 em by trying to distract us with the solution to 0 another .	
0 ... it 's as comprehensible as any Dummies guide 0 , something even non-techies can enjoy .	
0 Entertains not so much because of its music or co0 mic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of0  watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cra0 cker barrel .	
0 Writer\/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in 0 Quirky , with mixed results .	
0 Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on 0 the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the emp0 ty theatres graced with its company .	
0 Invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rain0 bow of emotion .	
0 `` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contri0 ved sequels that not only fails on its own , but 0 makes you second-guess your affection for the ori0 ginal .	
0 Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tag1 line - there 's definite room for improvement .

0 One of recent memory 's most thoughtful films abo0 ut art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromis0 e .	
1 The narrative is so consistently unimaginative th0 at probably the only way to have saved the film i-1 s with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Scie0 nce Theater 3000 guys .	
0 Filmmaker Tian Zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns 0 to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful2  work of quiet power .	
0 A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird 0 Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point o0 f view nor a compelling reason for being .	
1 Takes one character we do n't like and another we0  do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of 0 wills that is impossible to care about and is n't0  very funny .	
0 And if you appreciate the one-sided theme to Lawr0 ence 's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourse0 lf out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is 0 a self-glorified Martin Lawrence lovefest .	
0 The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as i0 f the director is trying to dupe the viewer into 1 taking it all as Very Important simply because th0 e movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood pr0 oduct .	
0 Whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earne1 st dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a0  surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pin1 nacle to pinnacle rouses us .	
0 Swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobb0 y that attracts the young and fit .	
-1 But when it does , you 're entirely unprepared .	0 
1 Devos delivers a perfect performance that capture0 s the innocence and budding demons within a wallf0 lower .	
0 300 years of Russian history and culture compress1 ed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous st0 ream of consciousness .	
0 The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us 0 a good time , and in their cheap , B movie way , 1 they succeed .	
0 Mr. Polanski is in his element here : alone , aba0 ndoned , but still consoled by his art , which is0  more than he has ever revealed before about the 1 source of his spiritual survival .	
0 `` Spider-man is better than any summer blockbust0 er we had to endure last summer , and hopefully ,0  sets the tone for a summer of good stuff .	
0 Absorbing character	
-2 Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .	
0 It 's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land0  that prove more potent and riveting than the unl0 ikely story of Sarah and Harrison .	
0 Winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic ,0  achieving some honest insight into relationships0  that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat0  storylines , precious circumstances and beautifu0 l stars .	
0 If Mostly Martha is mostly unsurprising , it 's s0 till a sweet , even delectable diversion .	
0 A thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait -1 of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some p0 owerful people , seen through the eyes of the ide0 alistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimatel0 y losing cause .	
0 Keenly observed and refreshingly natural , Swimmi1 ng gets the details right , from its promenade of0  barely clad bodies in Myrtle Beach , S.C. , to t-1 he adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the 0 diner .	
1 A brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid 0 for it and those who pay to see it .	
0 A triumph , a film that hews out a world and carr0 ies us effortlessly from darkness to light .	
0 Just about everyone involved here seems to be coa0 sting .	
0 A fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hook0 ed on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fictio0 n .	
0 I suspect this is the kind of production that wou0 ld have been funnier if the director had released0  the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a0  bonus feature on the DVD .	
0 It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are ther0 e Tolstoy groupies out there ?	
0 Daughter From Danang reveals that efforts toward 0 closure only open new wounds .	
0 One of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpr0 edictable character pieces .	
0 Intriguing and downright intoxicating .	
0 Although fairly involving as far as it goes , the0  film does n't end up having much that is fresh t0 o say about growing up Catholic or , really , any0 thing .	
-1 The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and eve-1 n if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond0  comprehension .	
0 Sleek and arty .	
-1 Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy 0 dialogue highlight the radical action .	
0 -LRB- Cho 's face is -RRB- an amazing slapstick i0 nstrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug sh0 ots .	
1 It gets the details of its time frame right but i0 t completely misses its emotions .	
0 Initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote 0 sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes na0 rrative expedience .	
0 It lets you brush up against the humanity of a ps0 ycho , without making him any less psycho .	
1 Like the world of his film , Hartley created a mo0 nster but did n't know how to handle it .	
0 When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy G1 iannini , Madonna gives her best performance sinc0 e Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Da0 ngerous Game .	
0 Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splas0 h .	
-1 Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage t0 o Them , Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie0  thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a-1  silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp throug0 h horror and hellish conditions .	
1 It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing -1 on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to mak0 e something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddbal0 ls .	
0 Spielberg 's realization of a near-future America0  is masterful .	
0 There 's a scientific law to be discerned here th0 at producers would be well to heed : Mediocre mov0 ies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up-1  ; when the explosions start , they fall to piece0 s .	
0 He 's one of the few ` cool ' actors who never se0 ems aware of his own coolness .	
2 Feels like the work of an artist who is simply ti0 red -- of fighting the same fights , of putting t0 he weight of the world on his shoulders , of play0 ing with narrative form .	
0 ... stale and uninspired .	
0 In the director 's cut , the film is not only a l0 ove song to the movies but it also is more fully 0 an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping m0 ovie experience it rhapsodizes .	
2 Has the rare capability to soothe and break your 0 heart with a single stroke .	
0 Eerily accurate depiction of depression .	
0 As a feature-length film , it wears out its welco0 me as tryingly as the title character .	
0 An uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its uni0 versal points without lectures or confrontations 0 . '	
0 The story alone could force you to scratch a hole0  in your head .	
0 It 's the filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of0  what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes -1 Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summ0 er diversion .	
0 As any creature-feature fan knows , when you cros0 s toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creature0 s , you get a lot of running around , screaming a0 nd death .	
0 You bet there is and it 's what makes this rather1  convoluted journey worth taking .	
0 Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a-1  bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainbe0 rg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing s0 hort story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply u0 nsettling experience .	
0 Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an -LRB- emotio0 nally at least -RRB- adolescent audience demandin0 g regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible s0 exual violence to keep it interested .	
0 Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hol0 lywood kids and people who owe favors to their fa0 mous parents .	
0 A well-made but emotionally scattered film whose 0 hero gives his heart only to the dog .	
1 Those who love Cinema Paradiso will find the new 0 scenes interesting , but few will find the movie 1 improved .	
1 Campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in t0 he middle of sad in the middle of hopeful .	
0 Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagate1 lle that plays like a loosely-connected string of0  acting-workshop exercises .	
1 It 's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects0  .	
0 Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message 0 at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poet0 ic far too much for our taste .	
-1 Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RR0 B- movie .	
0 ... the one thing this Wild film has that other I0 max films do n't : chimps , lots of chimps , all 0 blown up to the size of a house .	
-1 Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thud0 s to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incom0 petent conclusion .	
0 This is a children 's film in the truest sense .	0 
-1 Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainl0 y dull and visually ugly when it is n't incompreh0 ensible .	
0 Beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that sh1 ould attract upscale audiences hungry for quality0  and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep the0 m guessing .	
0 An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism 0 .	
-1 The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnu0 mber the hits by three-to-one .	
1 Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with0  strong themes of familial ties and spirituality 0 that are powerful and moving without stooping to 0 base melodrama	
0 Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross th0 at made Mamet 's `` House of Games '' and last fa0 ll 's `` Heist '' so much fun .	
0 The film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving 0 , sometimes all at once .	
0 At a brief 42 minutes , we need more X and less b0 lab .	
0 The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out 0 comedy .	
0 There 's a great deal of corny dialogue and prepo0 sterous moments .	
0 Uneven but a lot of fun .	
0 The result might look like Vulgar .	
0 The film rehashes several old themes and is cappe-2 d with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely viole0 nt and very graphic .	
0 The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire a0 nd you wo n't be disappointed .	
0 It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic thi0 ngs happen to people .	
0 Manages to please its intended audience -- childr0 en -- without placing their parents in a coma-lik0 e state .	
0 The movie generates plot points with a degree of 0 randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawi0 ng .	
0 Though the film never veers from its comic course0  , its unintentional parallels might inadvertentl0 y evoke memories and emotions which are anything 0 but humorous .	
0 The film can depress you about life itself .	
0 If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off0  , convinced that you had already seen that movie0  .	
0 You get the impression that writer and director B0 urr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense 0 of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfacti0 on usually associated with the better private sch0 ools .	
0 This is a superior horror flick .	
-1 The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a 0 fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .	
0 A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .	
1 But they do n't fit well together and neither is 1 well told .	
0 Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly 0 enough .	
1 More sophisticated and literate than such picture0 s usually are ... an amusing little catch .	
0 Storytelling feels slight .	
0 Monte Cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought 0 story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfi-1 ghts as the revenge unfolds .	
0 It 's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned Ind0 ian film culture that allows Americans to finally1  revel in its splendor .	
1 Well-done supernatural thriller with keen insight0 s into parapsychological phenomena and the soulfu0 l nuances of the grieving process .	
0 ... only Bond can save us from the latest eccentr0 ic , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world dom0 ination and destruction .	
-2 It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved0  , the movie equivalent of staring into an open w0 ound .	
0 Damon brings the proper conviction to his role as0  -LRB- Jason Bourne -RRB- .	
-1 Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance 0 .	
0 When it 's this rich and luscious , who cares ?	
0 A singularly off-putting romantic comedy .	
0 Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a r0 outine slasher film that was probably more fun to0  make than it is to sit through .	
0 Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trus-1 ted audiences to understand a complex story , and0  left off the film 's predictable denouement .	
0 A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old fami0 liar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with0  ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time 2 and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard0  to find .	
1 An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a 0 workable primer for the region 's recent history 1 , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning t0 ool .	
0 Cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation -LRB- ca-1 reer - kids = misery -RRB- in tiresome romantic-c0 omedy duds .	
0 A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to of1 ten play like a milquetoast movie of the week blo0 wn up for the big screen .	
0 His work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing 1 of typical love stories .	
0 An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor0  than its predecessor .	
0 Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of 0 TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-d1 own version of Love Story .	
0 The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland 0 , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight in-1 to why , for instance , good things happen to bad0  people .	
-1 The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the e0 xperience of staring at a blank screen .	
0 They threw loads of money at an idea that should 0 've been so much more even if it was only made fo0 r teenage boys and wrestling fans .	
-1 It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused ,0  less interesting and more sloppily made film cou0 ld possibly come down the road in 2002 .	
0 Though the film is well-intentioned , one could r1 ent the original and get the same love story and 0 parable .	
0 Jolting into Charleston rhythms , the story has t0 he sizzle of old news that has finally found the 0 right vent -LRB- accurate ?	
0 Or both .	
0 Williams plays Sy , another of his open-faced , s1 miling madmen , like the killer in Insomnia .	
0 Phoned-in business as usual .	
-1 With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless acti0 on , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom ti0 er of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .	
0 Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the ur0 ge to doze .	
0 Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a l-1 ot of very bad Scouse accents	
0 In an era where big stars and high production val0 ues are standard procedure , Narc strikes a defia0 ntly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporarie1 s with daring and verve .	
0 A rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hai0 rs on your chest .	
1 ... a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as0  the mind .	
0 Miyazaki is one of world cinema 's most wondrousl0 y gifted artists and storytellers .	
0 A chronicle not only of one man 's quest to be pr0 esident , but of how that man single-handedly tur-1 ned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journal0 ists into what was essentially , by campaign 's e0 nd , an extended publicity department .	
0 Provides the kind of ` laugh therapy ' I need fro0 m movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing chara1 cters , and a happy ending .	
-1 Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .	
0 At a time when commercialism has squeezed the lif0 e out of whatever idealism American moviemaking e1 ver had , Godfrey Reggio 's career shines like a 0 lonely beacon .	
0 Director Roger Michell does so many of the little0  things right that it 's difficult not to cuss hi0 m out severely for bungling the big stuff .	
0 Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers r1 eal bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest tr0 iumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in th0 e film 's thick shadows .	
0 This movie may not have the highest production va1 lues you 've ever seen , but it 's the work of an0  artist , one whose view of America , history and-1  the awkwardness of human life is generous and de0 ep .	
-1 Feral and uncomfortable .	
0 Sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first -LRB1 - as best I remember -RRB- , but still a very goo0 d time at the cinema .	
0 It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , a0 nd that 's because the laughs come from fairly ba0 sic comedic constructs .	
0 Black-and-white and unrealistic .	
0 The film is predictable in the reassuring manner 0 of a beautifully sung holiday carol .	
0 The only camouflage Carvey should now be consider0 ing is a paper bag to wear over his head when he 0 goes out into public , to avoid being recognized -1 as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .	
0 Not about scares but a mood in which an ominous ,0  pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below 0 the proceedings and adds an almost constant minds0 et of suspense .	
0 Some of the computer animation is handsome , and 0 various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity 0 to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the fil0 m never rises above mediocrity .	
0 Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid 0 performances and eerie atmosphere .	
0 A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musing0 s and philosophy .	
0 Now as a former Gong Show addict , I 'll admit it0  , my only complaint is that we did n't get more 0 re-creations of all those famous moments from the0  show .	
0 Genuinely unnerving .	
0 The increasingly diverse French director has crea0 ted a film that one can honestly describe as look1 ing , sounding and simply feeling like no other f0 ilm in recent history .	
0 One of those joyous films that leaps over nationa0 l boundaries and celebrates universal human natur0 e .	
-1 A difficult but worthy film that bites off more t-1 han it can chew by linking the massacre of Armeni-1 ans in 1915 with some difficult relationships in 0 the present .	
0 Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .	0 
0 Witty and often surprising , a dark little morali0 ty tale disguised as a romantic comedy .	
0 One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier f0 ilm that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure 0 complaint against fathers , and circles it obsess0 ively , without making contact .	
0 In fact , even better .	
0 ... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of Jo0 hn Woo bullet ballet .	
1 Proves that some movie formulas do n't need messi1 ng with -- like the big-bug movie .	
-1 An uplifting , largely bogus story .	
0 Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fasc0 inating performances , the way to that destinatio0 n is a really special walk in the woods .	
0 Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a1  series of riveting set pieces the likes of which0  mainstream audiences have rarely seen .	
1 A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame0  to the last .	
1 After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seein0 g	
1 It has become apparent that the franchise 's best0  years are long past .	
0 Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is0  good-natured and never dull , but its virtues ar0 e small and easily overshadowed by its predictabi0 lity .	
0 Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 0 's social critique , casting its audience as that0  of intellectual lector in contemplation of the a0 uteur 's professional injuries .	
0 Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her h0 usband seems more psychotic than romantic , and n0 othing in the movie makes a convincing case that 0 one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss 0 we witness .	
0 The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .	0 
0 A mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a m0 uch better book .	
0 Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear0  you were watching monkeys flinging their feces a0 t you .	
0 In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direct0 ion , which has all the actors reaching for the b1 ack row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetr0 y .	
0 A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of D1 avid Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '	
1 First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it '-1 s kinda dumb .	
0 I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .	0 
-1 ... silly humbuggery ...	
1 Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some 0 visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut i0 t .	
1 A smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy .	
0 -LRB- A -RRB- rather thinly-conceived movie .	
0 Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires1  trembling and gratitude .	
0 Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turn-1 ing frenzy that Clancy creates .	
0 A slight but sweet film .	
0 Got a David Lynch jones ?	
-1 Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock 0 .	
0 Time of Favor could have given audiences the time0  of day by concentrating on the elements of a rev0 ealing alienation among a culture of people who s0 adly are at hostile odds with one another through0  recklessness and retaliation .	
1 `` Austin Powers in Goldmember '' has the right s-1 tuff for silly summer entertainment and has enoug0 h laughs to sustain interest to the end .	
-1 What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music 0 in Britney Spears ' first movie .	
0 The filmmakers might want to look it up .	
0 While maintaining the appearance of clinical obje0 ctivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but 0 often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest 0 .	
0 There is simply no doubt that this film asks the 2 right questions at the right time in the history 0 of our country .	
0 A dreary movie .	
0 Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spa0 rk or two when they first appear , they ca n't ge-1 nerate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comed0 y to start a reaction .	
0 To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow 0 , but he comes across as shallow and glib though 0 not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication th0 at he 's been responsible for putting together an1 y movies of particular value or merit .	
0 Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just eno0 ugh freshness into the proceedings to provide an 0 enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .	
0 Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game0  , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch0  in favor of gags that rely on the strength of th0 eir own cleverness as opposed to the extent of th0 eir outrageousness .	
0 What begins as a conventional thriller evolves in0 to a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-ch0 anging chance encounters .	
0 Buy popcorn .	
0 A late-night cable sexploitation romp masqueradin0 g as a thriller about the ruthless social order t0 hat governs college cliques .	
0 A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burde0 ned by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the1  earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree0  of accessibility .	
0 -LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a lon0 g while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of 0 saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie 1 business deserves from him right now .	
-1 Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its positio0 n remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's1  experiment is a successful one .	
0 Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... 0 is so intimate and sensual and funny and psycholo0 gically self-revealing that it makes most of what1  passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hys0 terics .	
0 Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to0  a biting satire that has no teeth .	
0 ... irritating soul-searching garbage .	
0 A solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the pric0 e of a ticket .	
0 Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking c0 odes and making movies .	
0 In comparison to his earlier films it seems a dis0 appointingly thin slice of lower-class London lif0 e ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly0  little .	
1 Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can ma0 ke undemanding action movies with all the alacrit0 y of their Hollywood counterparts .	
0 Except it 's much , much better .	
1 It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and story0 telling , an insane comic undertaking that ultima1 tely coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creat0 ive film .	
0 There is more than one joke about putting the toi0 let seat down .	
0 has -RRB-	
0 So original in its base concept that you can not 0 help but get caught up .	
0 It appears to have been made by people to whom th0 e idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entir0 ely foreign concept .	
0 If you ignore the cliches and concentrate on City0  by the Sea 's interpersonal drama , it ai n't ha0 lf-bad .	
0 A dreadful day in Irish history is given passiona-1 te , if somewhat flawed , treatment .	
0 See it .	
0 Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !	
2 A guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing 0 unless you want to laugh at it .	
-1 Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly di0 smissed heroes would be a film that is n't this p0 ainfully forced , false and fabricated .	
0 A relative letdown .	
0 ` Hey Arnold ! '	
0 But though he only scratches the surface , at lea0 st he provides a strong itch to explore more .	
0 The band performances featured in Drumline are re1 d hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point-1  of view , the film 's ice cold .	
-1 A non-mystery mystery .	
0 Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acti0 ng is the heart and soul of cinema .	
0 The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved sto0 ry .	
0 This is a monumental achievement in practically e-1 very facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idioti-2 c , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious 0 , and often downright creepy .	
1 The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...	0 
-1 One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 0 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some tim0 e .	
0 Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .	
1 Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon0  mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but wit1 hout any passion .	
1 Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as0  ` Wayne . '	
1 With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown ackno0 wledges the silent screams of workaday inertia bu0 t stops short of indulging its characters ' striv0 ing solipsism .	
0 It labours as storytelling .	
0 Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?	0 
0 The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , wit0 h its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of le0 ss - than-likely New York celebrities ... certain0 ly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been0  attached to before .	
0 Fails so fundamentally on every conventional leve-1 l that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .	0 
0 ... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly1  memorable .	
1 I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably n0 ot accurate to call it a movie .	
1 Though uniformly well acted , especially by young0  Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB0 - , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is sche0 matic and obvious .	
0 When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should 0 come a-knocking , no ?	
0 If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign 0 shores to show wary natives the true light is abh1 orrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite 0 likely be more like hell .	
1 It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Ho0 lly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emot0 ions of teendom , and its longevity gets more ine0 xplicable as the characterizations turn more cras0 sly reductive .	
0 For a movie audience , The Hours does n't connect1  in a neat way , but introduces characters who il1 luminate mysteries of sex , duty and love .	
0 Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as0  the kind of film that should be the target of so0 mething deeper and more engaging .	
0 Too clever by about nine-tenths .	
0 This is no `` Waterboy ! ''	
0 They 're going through the motions , but the zip 0 is gone .	
0 The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a reali0 stic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding0  crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that litt0 le of our emotional investment pays off .	
0 Not as good as the original , but what is ...	
0 Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a0  hip-hop documentary should give `` Scratch '' a 0 second look .	
-1 Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that 0 occasionally fortify this turgid fable .	
-1 An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself0  all too seriously .	
-1 Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-th0 e-top , and amateurish .	
0 Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carp0 enter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the behea0 dings .	
0 The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibi0 lities of its situation , and becomes one more du0 mb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dat0 es .	
0 With or without the sex , a wonderful tale of lov3 e and destiny , told well by a master storyteller0 	
0 Though it goes further than both , anyone who has0  seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little n0 ew here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Ga0 llo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the or0 dinary .	
1 A terrific date movie , whatever your orientation0  .	
0 Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed0  by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funn0 iest idea is n't funny .	
0 How do you make a movie with depth about a man wh0 o lacked any ?	
0 Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard .0  '	
1 `` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that 0 you get when sitting around a campfire around mid0 night , telling creepy stories to give each other0  the willies .	
0 Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-h0 our version released here in 1990 .	
1 An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizi0 ng of the big fight , pulls off enough of its eff0 ects to make up for the ones that do n't come off0  .	
0 Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and1  Heaven is one such beast .	
1 Very well written and directed with brutal honest1 y and respect for its audience .	
0 Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remai0 ns the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -0 - and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misundersto0 od career .	
-1 Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating perform0 ance .	
-2 ... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book t0 rying to make the outrage come even easier .	
1 Nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` Memen0 to ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` Req0 uiem for a Dream . '	
0 Every individual will see the movie through the p-1 rism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , b0 ut the one thing most will take away is the sense1  that peace is possible .	
0 Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a -1 caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny0  .	
-1 This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up1  looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming0  it .	
0 Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and r-1 edundant , with pitifully few real laughs .	
0 Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the re0 st of the cast is uniformly superb .	
0 Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bea0 r universe -- when are bears bears and when are t1 hey like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einst0 ein 's brain .	
0 `` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interestin0 g meditation on the ethereal nature of the intern0 et and the otherworldly energies it could channel0  , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .	
0 Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the mo0 st multilayered and sympathetic female characters0  of the year .	
0 The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Every0 man is in the details .	
1 The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each0  one of these people stand out and everybody else0  is in the background and it just seems manufactu0 red to me and artificial .	
0 Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film dir0 ectors , sadly proving once again ego does n't al0 ways go hand in hand with talent .	
0 Much credit must be given to the water-camera ope0 rating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Mich0 ael Stewart .	
0 In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the n0 ot-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .	
0 As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-y0 our-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to m0 e .	
0 Maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's not0 hing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted 0 and this one is .	
0 Would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled do0 wn a hill in a trash can ?	
-1 Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes0  , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .	
0 This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in tre0 ading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds0  up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .	
-1 To be oblivious to the existence of this film wou0 ld be very sweet indeed .	
0 Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to c0 reate an engaging story that keeps you guessing a0 t almost every turn .	
0 A porn film without the sex scenes .	
0 The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious st0 rength of snazziness while neglecting its less co0 nspicuous writing strength .	
0 Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's fina0 l half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY ,0  based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by S0 pader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Sh0 ainberg goes about telling what at heart is a swe0 et little girl -	
0 Despite slick production values and director Roge0 r Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect 1 is like having two guys yelling in your face for 0 two hours .	
0 `` Barbershop '' is a good-hearted ensemble comed0 y with a variety of quirky characters and an enga0 ging story .	
0 A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches an1 d pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial 0 for NBA properties .	
0 An ambitious , serious film that manages to do vi0 rtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is 0 something akin to an act of cinematic penance .	
1 Consistently clever and suspenseful .	
0 Soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film .	
0 Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accent0 s thick as mud .	
1 A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can b1 e considered work .	
0 Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , a0 t the very least , a big box of consolation candy0  .	
0 Bearable .	
0 Cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow an0 d a minor miracle of self-expression .	
0 But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his 0 cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on h-1 ow governments lie , no matter who runs them .	
0 See it for his performance if nothing else .	
0 The asylum material is gripping , as are the scen0 es of Jia with his family .	
0 I walked away from this new version of E.T. just 0 as I hoped I would -- with moist eyes .	
0 Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or se0 rious drama .	
1 plays like some corny television production from 0 a bygone era	
-1 It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed0  to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming W1 ashington as possibly the best actor working in m0 ovies today .	
1 Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his 0 own joke	
0 Here 's a case of two actors who do everything hu0 manly possible to create characters who are sweet1  and believable , and are defeated by a screenpla-1 y that forces them into bizarre , implausible beh0 avior .	
1 Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal thres0 hold of watching sad but endearing characters do 0 extremely unconventional things .	
0 Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it do0 es cathartic truth telling .	
0 Though writer\/director Bart Freundlich 's film u0 ltimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysf0 unctional parent-child relationship , it has some0  special qualities and the soulful gravity of Cru0 dup 's anchoring performance .	
0 -LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters are both overpla0 yed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety h0 as never been his trademark .	
0 This beautifully animated epic is never dull .	
0 Charming and witty , it 's also somewhat clumsy .0 	
-1 In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganis0 m , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantin0 o 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes0  .	
-1 frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet 's crimes 0 a political context	
0 Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell ?	
0 A serviceable Euro-trash action extravaganza , wi0 th a decent sense of humor and plenty of things t0 hat go boom -- handguns , BMWs and seaside chatea0 us .	
0 Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily a-1 t the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-0 in-the-city misadventures .	
0 It sends you away a believer again and quite chee0 red at just that .	
0 The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stage0 y .	
0 Interview With the Assassin is structured less as0  a documentary and more as a found relic , and as-1  such the film has a difficult time shaking its B0 lair Witch Project real-time roots .	
1 It is most remarkable not because of its epic sco-1 pe , but because of the startling intimacy it ach0 ieves despite that breadth .	
0 A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulg0 ent .	
1 Seems like something American and European gay mo0 vies were doing 20 years ago .	
-1 Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which0  is its essential problem .	
0 Mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who0  we want to help -- or hurt .	
0 Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing play0 s like Clueless Does South Fork .	
0 Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made a0 ll the more poignant by the incessant use of cell0  phones .	
0 The concept is a hoot .	
0 A straight-shooting family film which awards anim1 als the respect they 've rarely been given .	
0 The directive to protect the code at all costs al-1 so begins to blur as the importance of the man an0 d the code merge	
0 What Eric Schaeffer has accomplished with Never A0 gain may not , strictly speaking , qualify as rev0 olutionary .	
0 Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .	
0 What can one say about a balding 50-year-old acto0 r playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?	
0 Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's cen0 ter .	
0 Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio -1 never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motio0 n picture .	
0 A little more intensity and a little less charm w0 ould have saved this film a world of hurt .	
1 Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is hone0 stly affecting , but more of it seems contrived a0 nd secondhand .	
0 Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of s0 tylistic elements .	
0 Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !	
0 Sweet Home Alabama is n't going to win any Academ0 y Awards , but this date-night diversion will def0 initely win some hearts .	
1 Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I ce0 rtainly was n't feeling any of it .	
0 Too long , and larded with exposition , this somb0 er cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scru0 ffy sands of its titular community .	
1 The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensu0 ing complications are too manipulative ; the mess0 age is too blatant ; the resolutions are too conv0 enient .	
0 In some ways , Lagaan is quintessential Bollywood0  .	
0 A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-o0 f-age movie .	
1 A wry , affectionate delight .	
0 Credit director Ramsay for taking the sometimes i0 mprobable story and making it feel realistic .	
0 The auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights a0 re telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives0  the film its lingering tug .	
0 Gets better after Foster leaves that little room 0 .	
0 Despite its lavish formalism and intellectual aus0 terity , the film manages to keep you at the edge0  of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , po1 litical intrigue and brushes with calamity .	
0 Friday After Next is the kind of film that could 0 only be made by African-Americans because of its 0 broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americ0 ans .	
0 As lively an account as Seinfeld is deadpan .	
-1 Brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- 0 women 's depression .	
0 Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , o0 nly to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing0  , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 0 1980s .	
0 Definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` 0 laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . 0 '	
0 A heartening tale of small victories and enduring0  hope .	
0 An emotionally strong and politically potent piec0 e of cinema .	
-1 An extremely unpleasant film .	
-1 More intellectually scary than dramatically invol0 ving .	
0 A puzzling experience .	
0 Jonah is only so-so ... the addition of a biblica0 l message will either improve the film for you , 0 or it will lessen it .	
0 I hope the movie is widely seen and debated with -1 appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness .	
0 Intelligent and moving .	
0 This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned0  marks to take on any life of its own .	
1 Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - hom0 age pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , 0 dry , dry .	
0 The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will lin0 ger long after this film has ended .	
-1 As Warren he stumbles in search of all the emotio0 ns and life experiences he 's neglected over the 0 years .	
0 It should have stayed there .	
-1 ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV sch0 mucks who do n't know how to tell a story for mor0 e than four minutes .	
0 It is not the first time that director Sara Sugar0 man stoops to having characters drop their pants 0 for laughs and not the last time she fails to pro0 voke them .	
0 There 's no point of view , no contemporary inter-1 pretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we '0 re left thinking the only reason to make the movi0 e is because present standards allow for plenty o0 f nudity .	
0 There is a strong directorial stamp on every fram1 e of this stylish film that is able to visualize 0 schizophrenia but is still confident enough to st-1 ep back and look at the sick character with a san0 e eye .	
0 Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .	
-1 This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly ba0 d and absolutely unnecessary .	
0 As saccharine as it is disposable .	
0 Captures the raw comic energy of one of our most 0 flamboyant female comics .	
1 A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is f0 lawed , compromised and sad .	
0 An exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop dr0 ama .	
0 Even in the summertime , the most restless young 0 audience deserves the dignity of an action hero m0 otivated by something more than franchise possibi0 lities .	
0 Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , ho0 pe and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far 0 closer than many movies to expressing the way man0 y of us live -- someplace between consuming self-0 absorption and insistently demanding otherness .	0 
1 She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and0  a conniving wit .	
0 Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms 0 are not to be dismissed .	
0 So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as ann0 oying rather than charming .	
-1 Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre0  .	
0 The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-1 -camp talent show : hastily written , underrehear-1 sed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude h-1 umor and vulgar innuendo .	
0 The cast comes through even when the movie does n0 't .	
-1 A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of-1  suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre ban0 k robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son0  dynamics .	
-2 It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to 0 see people working so hard at leading lives of se1 xy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassi0 onate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .0 	
1 Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Dam0 me look good .	
0 But if the essence of magic is its make-believe p0 romise of life that soars above the material real0 m , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie0  .	
0 But its storytelling prowess and special effects 0 are both listless .	
0 I stopped thinking about how good it all was , an0 d started doing nothing but reacting to it - feel0 ing a part of its grand locations , thinking urge0 ntly as the protagonists struggled , feeling at t0 he mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its vi0 sual delights .	
0 Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a b0 adly handled screenplay of what is really an amus0 ing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms it0 s wearer into a superman .	
-1 One Hour Photo may seem disappointing in its gene0 ralities , but it 's the little nuances that perh0 aps had to escape from director Mark Romanek 's s0 elf-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally g0 et under your skin .	
0 With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz take0 s aim on political correctness and suburban famil0 ies .	
0 A processed comedy chop suey .	
0 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-0 reflection meditation .	
1 Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is 1 a little too in love with its own cuteness .	
0 So purely enjoyable that you might not even notic0 e it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollyw0 ood comedies such as Father of the Bride .	
0 An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly hum0 anist -LRB- not to mention gently political -RRB-0  meditation on the values of knowledge , educatio0 n , and the affects of cultural and geographical 0 displacement .	
0 I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by0  the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent-1  R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice G0 uillen .	
0 A sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume0  drama set in Renaissance Spain , and the fact th0 at it 's based on true events somehow makes it al0 l the more compelling .	
1 The Santa Clause 2 proves itself a more streamlin0 ed and thought out encounter than the original co0 uld ever have hoped to be .	
0 Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the prev0 ious pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach 0 directed the film from the back of a taxicab .	
0 It 's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that1  lifts your spirits as well as the corners of you0 r mouth .	
0 Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a0  horrifying historical event and the elements whi0 ch contributed to it .	
0 Goes on and on to the point of nausea .	
0 -LRB- Raimi 's -RRB- matured quite a bit with Spi0 der-Man , even though it 's one of the most plain0  white toast comic book films you 'll ever see .	0 
0 It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musc0 lefest , but has a little too much resonance with0  real world events and ultimately comes off as in0 sultingly simplistic .	
-1 An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally0  fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .	
0 In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hila0 rious dialogue about following your dream and ` j0 ust letting the mountain tell you what to do . '	0 
0 A modestly surprising movie .	
1 ... a powerful sequel and one of the best films o0 f the year .	
0 Combines improbable melodrama -LRB- gored bullfig0 hters , comatose ballerinas -RRB- with subtly kin0 ky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , a0 nd yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .	
0 This is one of Mr. Chabrol 's subtlest works , bu0 t also one of his most uncanny .	
-1 This one is strictly a lightweight escapist film 0 .	
0 It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equ0 ivalent of a chick flick .	
0 If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the an0 swer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come acro0 ss these days ? ''	
0 Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using 0 a plot that could have come from an animated-movi0 e screenwriting textbook .	
-1 Not that any of us should be complaining when a f0 ilm clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but 0 the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .	
0 There is a freedom to watching stunts that are th0 is crude , this fast-paced and this insane .	
-1 ` This movie sucks . '	
0 Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee0  against a tree .	
-1 A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are 0 forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honk0 s .	
0 The movie is too amateurishly square to make the 0 most of its own ironic implications .	
0 What sets this romantic comedy apart from most Ho0 llywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of t1 ackling what seems like done-to-death material .	0 
0 The film 's constant mood of melancholy and its u0 nhurried narrative are masterfully controlled .	
0 Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time	
0 One gets the impression the creators of Do n't As-1 k Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their ow0 n jokes .	
0 Schrader aims to present an unflinching look at o-1 ne man 's downfall , brought about by his lack of0  self-awareness .	
0 After that it becomes long and tedious like a cla0 ssroom play in a college history course .	
-1 Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in to0 o many conflicts to keep the story compelling .	
0 A small gem of a movie that defies classification0  and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , sca0 ry and sad .	
0 Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as D0 emme experiments he harvests a few movie moment g0 ems , but the field of roughage dominates .	
0 While the story is better-focused than the incomp0 rehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Que-1 en Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering cele0 bration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me 0 lifestyle .	
0 The color sense of Stuart Little 2 is its most im0 mediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would 0 count for very little if the movie were n't as be0 autifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in 0 tone as it is .

0 As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mys1 terious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn 0 toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .	0 
1 Will certainly appeal to Asian cult cinema fans a-1 nd Asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss0  is about .	
0 Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the0  film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is s0 eriously compromised by that .	
-1 Evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the 0 euphoria of growing up , without relying on the u0 sual tropes .	
1 Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kin0 d of documentary , one that makes a depleted yest2 erday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .	0 
0 This is a very ambitious project for a fairly ine0 xperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poe0 try and good music help sustain it .	
0 A thriller whose style , structure and rhythms ar0 e so integrated with the story , you can not sepa0 rate them .	
0 It 's mostly a pleasure to watch .	
-1 The first question to ask about Bad Company is wh0 y Anthony Hopkins is in it .	
0 Nair and writer Laura Cahill dare to build a movi-1 e around some flawed but rather unexceptional wom0 en , emerging with a fine character study that 's0  short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations o0 f real life .	
0 Goofy , nutty , consistently funny .	
0 Audiard successfully maintains suspense on differ0 ent levels throughout a film that is both grippin0 g and compelling .	
0 Welles groupie\/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a 0 long time to do it , but he 's finally provided h0 is own broadside at publishing giant William Rand0 olph Hearst .

0 Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by hi0 s pretensions .	
0 Fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find so0 me fun in this jumbled mess .	
1 We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern ha0 d just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins '0  and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script 0 machine .	
0 Mostly works because of the universal themes , ea0 rnest performances ... and excellent use of music1  by India 's popular Gulzar and Jagjit Singh .	
0 A perceptive , good-natured movie .	
0 This is n't a stand up and cheer flick ; it 's a 0 sit down and ponder affair .	
0 One of the pleasures in Walter 's documentary ...0  is the parade of veteran painters , confounded d0 ealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon-1  the subject 's mysterious personality without ev0 er explaining him .	
0 Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , r0 espectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to p-1 rove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad h0 air design .	
0 The real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comi0 c face of its star , Jean Reno , who resembles Sl1 y Stallone in a hot sake half-sleep .	
0 And there 's an element of heartbreak to watching0  it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we 0 know what will happen after Greene 's story ends 0 .	
0 Rather than real figures

0 A visual spectacle full of stunning images and ef0 fects .	
0 There is something that is so meditative and lyri0 cal about Babak Payami 's boldly quirky Iranian d0 rama Secret Ballot ... a charming and evoking lit0 tle ditty that manages to show the gentle and hum0 ane side of Middle Eastern world politics	
-1 It 's easy to be cynical about documentaries in w0 hich underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit0  triumphs , but Westbrook 's foundation and Dalry0 mple 's film earn their uplift .

0 A compelling allegory about the last days of Germ0 any 's democratic Weimar Republic .	
0 Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over1  Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 child0 ren 's novel .	
0 It is an indelible epic American story about two 0 families , one black and one white , facing chang0 e in both their inner and outer lives .	
0 It 's as raw and action-packed an experience as a0  ringside seat at a tough-man contest .	
0 ... -LRB- the film -RRB- works , due mostly to th0 e tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay .	
0 You walk out of The Good Girl with mixed emotions0  -- disapproval of Justine combined with a tinge 0 of understanding for her actions .	
0 The movie strains to stay on the light , comic si-2 de of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing0  so when dealing with the destruction of property0  and , potentially , of life itself .	
0 Unfortunately the story and the actors are served-1  with a hack script .	
-1 This is an insultingly inept and artificial exami0 nation of grief and its impacts upon the relation0 ships of the survivors .	
0 The immersive powers of the giant screen and its 1 hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in 1 the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space document0 ary Space Station 3D .

0 Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over0  pastiche .	
0 Muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , 0 is a canny crowd pleaser , and The Last Kiss ... 0 provides more than enough sentimental catharsis f0 or a satisfying evening at the multiplex .

-1 Better than the tepid Star Trek : Insurrection ; -1 falls short of First Contact because the villain 0 could n't pick the lint off Borg Queen Alice Krig0 e 's cape ; and finishes half a parsec -LRB- a no0 se -RRB- ahead of Generations .	
0 Exploits -LRB- headbanger -RRB- stereotypes in go0 od fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettli0 ng subject matter .	
0 It 's just rather leaden and dull .	
1 Rice never clearly defines his characters or give0 s us a reason to care about them .	
0 Although the subject matter may still be too clos0 e to recent national events , the film works - mo0 stly due to its superior cast of characters .	
0 A deeply felt and vividly detailed story about ne-1 wcomers in a strange new world .	
-1 The film 's darker moments become smoothed over b0 y an overwhelming need to tender inspirational ti0 dings , especially in the last few cloying moment0 s .	
0 From the opening strains of the Average White Ban0 d 's `` Pick up the Pieces '' , you can feel the 1 love .	
0 Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fire0 s and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the0  movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .0 	
-1 Triple X is a double agent , and he 's one bad du0 de .	
0 There has been a string of ensemble cast romances1  recently ... but Peter Mattei 's Love in the Tim0 e of Money sets itself apart by forming a chain o0 f relationships that come full circle to end on a1  positive -LRB- if tragic -RRB- note .	
0 This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of act1 ion , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a s0 erious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it fe1 els like unrealized potential	
0 As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .	
0 Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that 0 everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artis0 t and a liar .	
0 The filmmakers ' eye for detail and the high stan0 dards of performance convey a strong sense of the0  girls ' environment .	
0 It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle i1 n recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while t0 he audience can tell it 's not all new , at least0  it looks pretty .	
0 or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute 0 rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-m0 o gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''	
0 Enough may pander to our basest desires for payba-1 ck , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultim0 ately delivers .

0 Only at the prospect of Beck 's next project .	
0 ... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw c0 oming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n0 ' roll .	
0 A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolen0 t deception , which , while it may not rival the 0 filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much w0 orth seeing .	
0 Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungl0 e their way through the narrative as if it were a0  series of Bible parables and not an actual story0  .	
-1 They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humor-1 ous to tediously sentimental .	
-1 It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utte0 rly painful to watch .	
0 Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a0  buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in 0 the theater lobby ?	
0 Evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is a0 n object lesson in period filmmaking .	
0 All three actresses are simply dazzling , particu-1 larly Balk , who 's finally been given a part wor0 thy of her considerable talents .	
-1 The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chi-1 ef draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to slee0 p .	
0 You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods ,0  and by its subtly transformed star , and still w0 onder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the incli0 nation to make the most sincere and artful movie 0 in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .0 	
0 The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silve0 r and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I 0 assume the director has pictures of them cavortin0 g in ladies ' underwear .	
0 Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , le0 aving the character of Critical Jim two-dimension-1 al and pointless .	
0 So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust a0 nd love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures -1 up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of0  a freshly painted Rembrandt .	
0 Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpre0 ting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for0  anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined gl0 ory of their own pasts .	
-1 In other words , it 's badder than bad .	
0 Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .	
0 Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superfi1 cial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , a0 nd the film settles too easily along the contours0  of expectation .	
1 Little is done to support the premise other than 0 fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .	
0 Brings to a spectacular completion one of the mos-1 t complex , generous and subversive artworks of t0 he last decade .	
0 With an obvious rapport with her actors and a str0 iking style behind the camera	
0 You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , 0 but it never quite gets there .	
0 A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never qui0 te equals the sum of its pretensions .	
0 Statham employs an accent that I think is suppose0 d to be an attempt at hardass American but someti0 mes just lapses into unhidden British .	
0 If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handl0 e the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states0  at one point in this movie that we `` do n't car0 e about the truth . ''	
0 So boring that even its target audience talked al0 l the way through it .	
0 Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to0  see it and left it lying there	
0 Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively ant0 i-erotic .	
0 The Hours , a delicately crafted film , is an imp0 ressive achievement in spite of a river of sadnes0 s that pours into every frame .	
0 Delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movem0 ent and inside information .	
0 Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset an0 d a detriment .	
0 -LRB- Dong -RRB- makes a valiant effort to unders0 tand everyone 's point of view , and he does such0  a good job of it that Family Fundamentals gets y0 ou riled up .	
0 Light the candles , bring out the cake and do n't-1  fret about the calories because there 's preciou0 s little substance in Birthday Girl -- it 's simp0 ly , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat .	
0 In his debut as a director , Washington has a sur0 e hand .	
0 -- but it makes for one of the most purely enjoya0 ble and satisfying evenings at the movies I 've h0 ad in a while .	
1 This is not Chabrol 's best , but even his lesser1  works outshine the best some directors can offer0  .	
0 The heart of the film is a touching reflection on0  aging , suffering and the prospect of death .	
2 It 's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffi0 th made in the early days of silent film .	
0 The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology t-1 hat 's just experimental enough to alienate the m0 ainstream audience while ringing cliched to harde0 ned indie-heads .	
1 The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's l0 imited but enthusiastic adaptation has made liter1 ature literal without killing its soul -- a feat 0 any thinking person is bound to appreciate .	
0 If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves yo0 u intriguingly contemplative .	
0 When all is said and done , she loves them to pie1 ces -- and so , I trust , will you .	
0 It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have0  seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LR0 B- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly ol0 d-fashioned .	
1 Director Claude Chabrol has become the master of 0 innuendo .	
0 Woven together handsomely , recalling sixties ' r0 ockumentary milestones from Lonely Boy to Do n't 0 Look Back .	
0 It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy f1 licks like this behind bars	
0 Paul Cox needed to show it .	
0 A film that will probably please people already f0 ascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawnin0 g with admiration .	
0 The huskies are beautiful , the border collie is 0 funny and the overall feeling is genial and decen0 t .	
0 They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they ar0 e in this tepid genre offering .

0 Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .	
0 A piquant meditation on the things that prevent p0 eople from reaching happiness .	
1 This movie is to be cherished .	
0 The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have lov0 ed it .	
0 Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurie0 nt .	
0 While Tattoo borrows heavily from both Seven and 0 The Silence of the Lambs , it manages to maintain2  both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human0 -scale characters that suck the audience in .	
0 Once he starts learning to compromise with realit1 y enough to become comparatively sane and healthy0  , the film becomes predictably conventional .	
0 The film is ... determined to treat its character0 s , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , 0 not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the -1 cost of the inevitable conflicts between human ur0 ges and an institution concerned with self-preser0 vation .	
1 Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists an0 d beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innov0 ators , Scratch is great fun , full of the kind o0 f energy it 's documenting .	
-1 While it is interesting to witness the conflict f-1 rom the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks -1 balance ... and fails to put the struggle into me0 aningful historical context .	
0 Producer John Penotti surveyed high school studen0 ts ... and came back with the astonishing revelat0 ion that `` they wanted to see something that did0  n't talk down to them . ''	
1 A real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and res0 onant .	
0 Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of grea0 test-hits reel that might come with a subscriptio0 n to ESPN the Magazine .	
0 Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped 0 characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a0  director undermine the moral dilemma at the movi0 e 's heart .	
0 Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-0 director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , w0 hich may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but0  has a huge heart .	
0 Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience0  of Job to get through this interminable , shapel0 ess documentary about the swinging subculture .	
0 I 'd watch these two together again in a New York0  minute .	
0 You can practically hear George Orwell turning ov0 er .	
1 Ferrara 's best film in years .	
0 Possibly not since Grumpy Old Men have I heard a 0 film so solidly connect with one demographic whil0 e striking out with another .	
0 No doubt the star and everyone else involved had 1 their hearts in the right place .

0 Poetry in motion captured on film .	
1 Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and yo0 u might not notice the flaws .	
0 None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take u0 s by surprise ...	
1 Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent dir0 ectorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently m-1 inimalist style finally has failed him .	
1 It 's like a `` Big Chill '' reunion of the Baade0 r-Meinhof Gang , only these guys are more harmles0 s pranksters than political activists .	
0 Ms. Hutchins is talented enough and charismatic e0 nough to make us care about Zelda 's ultimate fat0 e .	
0 Successfully blended satire , high camp and yet a0 nother sexual taboo into a really funny movie .	
0 Really is a pan-American movie , with moments of 1 genuine insight into the urban heart .	
0 Same song , second verse , coulda been better , b0 ut it coulda been worse .	
0 The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag0  along the dead -LRB- water -RRB- weight of the o0 ther .	
0 Crikey indeed .	
0 It 's exactly what you 'd expect .	
0 It 's definitely not made for kids or their paren0 ts , for that matter , and I think even fans of S0 andler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .0 	
0 You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't s-1 ign a pact to burn the negative and the script an0 d pretend the whole thing never existed .	
0 A stirring road movie .	
-1 If you 've grown tired of going where no man has 0 gone before , but several movies have - take hear0 t .	
0 It has more than a few moments that are insightfu1 l enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly0  challenging maze of moviegoing .	
0 It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n1 't necessarily an admirable storyteller .	
1 Perhaps the best sports movie I 've ever seen .	
0 Just send it to Cranky .	
0 Steven Soderbergh does n't remake Andrei Tarkovsk0 y 's Solaris so much as distill it .	
0 Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can0  just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of 0 other films , sell it to the highest bidder and w0 alk away without anyone truly knowing your identi0 ty .	
0 In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Claybur1 gh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice 0 it 's something else altogether -- clownish and o1 ffensive and nothing at all like real life .	
0 Works better in the conception than it does in th0 e execution ... winds up seeming just a little to0 o clever .	
0 New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places0  to dwell ...	
0 Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much0  .	
1 With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging 0 up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land1  of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love tri0 angles .	
0 Van Wilder has a built-in audience , but only amo0 ng those who are drying out from spring break and0  are still unconcerned about what they ingest .	
0 No , even that 's too committed .	
0 The large-frame IMAX camera lends itself beautifu0 lly to filming the teeming life on the reefs , ma1 king this gorgeous film a must for everyone from 0 junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers .	
0 Low comedy does n't come much lower .	
-1 The characterizations and dialogue lack depth or 0 complexity , with the ironic exception of Scooter0  .	
0 dramatic snapshot	
0 What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Lo0 yal Order of Raccoons .	
0 It 'll keep you wide awake and ... very tense .	
0 The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in0  his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions 0 into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Hol-1 ocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of a0 ll individuality .	
0 It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a0  spirit that can not be denied .	
0 Less an examination of neo-Nazism than a probe in0 to the nature of faith itself .	
1 Though few will argue that it ranks with the best0  of Herzog 's works , Invincible shows he 's back0  in form , with an astoundingly rich film .	
0 While it may not add up to the sum of its parts ,0  Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to0  keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemb0 le cast is engaging enough to keep you from shift0 ing in your chair too often .	
0 There are no special effects , and no Hollywood e0 ndings .	
0 Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohes0 ion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , 0 it is not enough to give the film the substance i-1 t so desperately needs .	
0 Not a schlocky creature feature but something far1  more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more 0 chillingly effective .	
0 From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply m-1 oving French drama develops a startling story tha0 t works both as a detailed personal portrait and -1 as a rather frightening examination of modern tim0 es .	
1 The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard1  appears to have had free rein to be as pretentio0 us as he wanted .	
1 A stylish cast and some clever scripting solution0 s help Chicago make the transition from stage to 1 screen with considerable appeal intact .	
0 Fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the 0 ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about1  a domestic unit finding their way to joy .

0 It 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie t0 atters and self-conscious seams in places , but h0 as some quietly moving moments and an intelligent0  subtlety .	
0 I was amused and entertained by the unfolding of 0 Bielinsky 's cleverly constructed scenario , and 0 greatly impressed by the skill of the actors invo0 lved in the enterprise .	
0 For most of the distance the picture provides a s0 atisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places 0 of our national psyche .

0 Star\/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Tay0 mor have infused Frida with a visual style unique0  and inherent to the titular character 's paintin1 gs and in the process created a masterful work of0  art of their own .	
0 This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected .	0 
0 But ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper 0 intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically 0 - distanced us from the characters .	
1 Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on i-1 ts sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy t1 o swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Fe0 rrera and Ontiveros .	
0 There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of t0 his slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .	
0 A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed wo0 rk .

0 The art direction is often exquisite , and the an0 thropomorphic animal characters are beautifully r0 ealized through clever makeup design , leaving on0 e to hope that the eventual DVD release will offe0 r subtitles and the original Italian-language sou0 ndtrack .	
0 It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless 0 film ...	
1 The creative animation work may not look as fully0  ` rendered ' as Pixar 's industry standard , but1  it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrou0 nds to an equally impressive degree .	
0 An often unfunny romp .	
0 It makes sense that he went back to school to che0 ck out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's ide0 a of a good time .	
0 Clever but not especially compelling .	
0 An EXIT sign , that is .	
0 It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its 0 primary goal without the use of special effects ,0  but rather by emphasizing the characters -- incl1 uding the supporting ones .	
0 The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid 0 way , finds one of our most conservative and hide0 bound movie-making traditions and gives it new te0 xture , new relevance , new reality .	
0 ... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV0  special , the humor would have been fast and fur-1 ious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .

1 The film exudes the urbane sweetness that Woody A-2 llen seems to have bitterly forsaken .	
0 The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak 0 and animal gibberish .	
0 Cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by 1 submerging it in a hoary love triangle .	
0 What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in th0 e hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at lea0 st during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as-1  lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature 0 .	
0 I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a0  long time .
